# React Hooks
 (Normal JS Utility Funcitons)
- useState() - Super powerful state variable - It keeps the data layer and ui layer in sync. setVariable is helpful in triggering DOM rendering when we update the state variable.
- useEffect()

 Whenever a state variable changes, React re-renders the component.
 # React
 - Reconciliation Algorithm is the algorithm that is build for DOM/Virtual DOM Manipulation. The algorihm has been updated later in React v16 and named it as 'React Fiber'.
 - Virtual DOM is a repreentation of Actual DOM.
 - React is fast because of virtual DOM. Vistual DOM uses Diff Algorithm to compare any changes in the DOM before rendering/updating the UI effectively and fastly.
